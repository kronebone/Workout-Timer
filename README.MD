# Workout-Timer
A timer for rest sets and total workout time. Uses a raspberry pi zero w with an oled hat.
- Oled hat with buttons: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3531
- Luma oled module used in this project: https://luma-oled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
	- Documentation has set up, installation and usage resources.
- My setup uses an @reboot cron job to run the app.
